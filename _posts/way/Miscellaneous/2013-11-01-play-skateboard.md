I bought a skateboard this week on ebay, with $39. And begin to learn how to play with it.

## Equipements
<br/>
helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, keepads, and appropriate footwear

I had thought most of them were not necessary for me, but someone told me that the medical fee in USA would be too much, especially for an F-1 students. So it's important to prevent being injured in case.

## Setps
<br/>

### 1 standing on skateboard, try on it in the grass
适应站在滑板上，可以在草地上练习

### 2 regular or goofy stance 两种站姿<br/>
regular -- stand with the left foot in front and push off and kick with the right<br/>
goofy -- skating with your right foot in front<br/>
right-handed people prefer the regular stance<br/>
一般右撇子倾向于左脚在前，右脚驱动

### 3 pratice on flat expanse of concrete, like a parking lot. It's nice that there is a one directly beside my place.<br/>
在平地上联系，比如停车场。我住的房子旁边正好有一个，夏天经常看到有人在练习滑板。<br/>
Partice in varies speeds.<br/>
练习用各种速度前进<br/>

### 4 ways to stop your rool 停下

- a) footbreaking
用脚停，靠脚底板的滑动摩擦力

- b) heel drag
用脚踩住滑板后端，脚后跟露出在滑板外，身子往后倾斜，滑板前端翘起，用脚后跟的滑动摩擦力

### 5. turn or carve 转弯

put the weight on your heels while rolling and you'll turn in that direction <br/>
It helps to lean your upper body in the direction you want to turn. <br/>
身体重心往滑板的一侧倾斜即可

### 6. kickturn 快速变向

balance on your rear wheels, push down, and spin your board around to execute a kickturn
这招在练习时场地又不是很宽敞的情况下很有用，可以控制滑板严近似直线前进而不需要驱动脚着地。

## Did you know? 小知识
<br/>

__The Ollie__, a trick in which a skater jumps into the air and lifts the board without using their hands, was invented by Alan "Ollie" Gelfand in 1978. 无辅助起跳
