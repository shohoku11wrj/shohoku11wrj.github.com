Definitely, Galileo Galilei's `Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo` will be the first post in my Physics category.

Here is an English version of this booklet: [Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/dialogue.html)

There is a paragraphy in the `Second Day`:

>Is it possible for you to doubt that if Anistotle should see the new discoveries in the sky he would change his opinions and correct his books and embrace the most sensible doctrines, casting away from himself those people so weak-minded as to be induced to go on abjectly maintaining everything he had ever said? Why, if Aristotle had been such a man as they imagine, he would have been a man of intractable mind, of obstinate spirit, and barbarous soul; a man of tyrannical will who, regarding all others as silly sheep, wished to have his decrees preferred over the senses, experience, and nature itself It is the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority, not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself And since it is handier to conceal oneself under the cloak of another than to show one's face in open court, they dare not in their timidity get a single step away from him, and rather than put any alterations into the heavens of Aristotle, they want to deny out of hand those that they see in nature's heaven.

As [changhai](http://www.changhai.org/articles/miscellaneous/misc/collection_social.php#galilei) translated it as:

>你难道怀疑如果亚里斯多德看到天空中的这些新发现， 他会改变自己的观点， 修改自己的著作，
拥抱最理智的学说， 并抛弃那些弱智到只会悲哀地墨守他说过的每一句话的人吗？ .... 亚里斯多德若果真如他们所想象， 那他将是一个头脑僵化、 精神顽固、 灵魂野蛮的人， 一个有着视别人为蠢货、 用自己的教条取代理性、 经验及自然本身的暴虐意愿的人。 是亚里斯多德的追随者而非他本人将权威的皇冠强加给了他。

It's cool that I have the opportunity to mention these words in the first post of my Physics category.
